# 🎵 Spotify Streaming Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project is being developed as part of the **Data Analytics with AI Hackathon: Dashboard Essentials**.  
Our team is analysing Spotify streaming data to explore how different audio features, genres, and release trends influence a song’s popularity.

We are building an **interactive dashboard** that makes it easy for users to explore the data, uncover patterns, and gain insights through clear visual storytelling.  
Alongside the dashboard, the project includes full ETL processing, exploratory analysis, and applied analytics that link directly to the hackathon’s Learning Outcomes (LO1–LO11).

Through collaborative teamwork, the project demonstrates:
- A complete **ETL pipeline** for preparing and validating streaming data  
- Detailed exploration of song attributes and popularity trends  
- An **interactive dashboard** that allows dynamic filtering and visual insights  
- Clear, ethical, and well-documented project delivery aligned with the hackathon specification

## 🎯 Project Goal
The aim of this project is to analyse Spotify’s music dataset to understand the relationship between song attributes and streaming popularity.  
We want to identify key patterns, trends, and characteristics that drive listener engagement — for example, how features like energy, danceability, tempo, or valence vary across genres and time periods.

Alongside the analysis, we are building an **interactive dashboard** that allows users to:
- Explore audio features across genres and years  
- Visualise trends in popularity over time  
- Compare characteristics of top-performing tracks  
- Discover insights in a clear, accessible way  

Overall, the goal is to use data analytics, visualisation, and ethical AI support to tell a data-driven story about modern music trends.

## 📊 Dataset Information
For this project, we are using the **Spotify Tracks Dataset** published on Kaggle.  
Dataset link: *“Spotify Songs Dataset – Kaggle”* by Maharshi Pandya.

The dataset contains thousands of songs with detailed information, including:
- **Track details** (track name, artist, album, release date)
- **Popularity score**
- **Audio features**, such as:
  - danceability  
  - energy  
  - valence (positivity)  
  - tempo  
  - loudness  
  - acousticness  
  - instrumentalness  
  - speechiness  
  - liveness  
- **Genre labels**  
- **Duration** and other metadata  

This dataset is well-structured and ideal for exploring how music characteristics influence streaming behaviour. It supports the creation of visualisations, statistical tests, and interactive dashboards aligned with the hackathon requirements.
